# DEMCEM
Direct Evaluation Method in Computational ElectroMagnetics (DEMCEM) package is free software for the accurate and efficient evaluation of singular integrals arising in Galerkin EM surface integral equation formulations over triangular tessellations. It was developed by Athanasios G. Polimeridis during his postdoctoral studies at LEMA-EPFL. 

## Download

The source code of DEMCEM can be found in Matlab and C++. Also, mex plugins are available to provide a fast Matlab interface to this functionality. ReadMe before getting started. 

You are welcome to report any bugs found while testing! 

## Acknowledgements

Part of the Matlab code was developed with the help of José M. Tamayo, during his visit (September-December 2010) at LEMA-EPFL. Special thank goes to Michael Mattes for his valuable advice and constant support.
